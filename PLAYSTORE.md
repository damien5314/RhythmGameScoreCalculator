RGSC is an Android application used for calculating score for several music rhythm games. This is useful for recalculating scores due to pad errors, etc. Currently supported games are:
- In the Groove
- Dance Dance Revolution 8th Mix (Extreme) - X3

Notes:
- You must know the maximum number of holds in a song for the score to be calculated properly. Some games do not display this.
- DDR X/X2/X3 scoring works the same as SN2, so you can use the same calculator tab for these games. Hitting a shock arrow counts the same as dropping a hold.

If you have a request for support of a specific game, let me know in a review and I'll do my best to post an update. Thanks for using RGSC!
